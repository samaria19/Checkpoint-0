// Strings

/* 
First, declare variable named firstName.

Assign firstName to a string value of your first name.

Declare another variable named lastName and assign it the value of your last name.

Then declare another variable named fullName and assign it to the current value of firstName and lastName and have the joined values separated with a space character.
Remember that computer languages will not add the space character for you so how would you do that manually?

Declare a variable named luckyNumber.
Assign luckyNumber to a number of your choice.
Declare another variable named luckyNumberTimes2 and assign it the value of luckyNumber multiplied by 2.
*/


//Booleans
